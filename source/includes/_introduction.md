# Introduction

The Candide Marketplace API is organised around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can currently use the Candide Marketplace API to manage your shop's inventory. We don't currently offer any dedicated client libraries. Code examples can be viewed in the dark area to the right.
